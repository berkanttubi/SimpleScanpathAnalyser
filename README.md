Eye tracking does not only allow us to understand which areas of interest (AOIs) of visual stimuli take the most attention, but also allows us to understand in which order these AOIs are used. Figure 1 shows an example of an eye movement sequence (i.e. scanpath) of a particular person on the home page of the Babylon website.
